### 🧬 About Me

I’m a musician and researcher exploring the intersection of creativity, music, and technology.  
My work bridges modern fusion composition, improvisation, and the cognitive processes behind musical expression.  
I'm currently expanding into data science to explore how data can illuminate human decision-making, emotion, and creativity.

My interests include algorithmic bias, human-AI collaboration, and the ethical questions emerging from art and machine learning.
